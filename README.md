# timestable

A means of testing times tables for primary school age children.

The program runs through levels of times tables based on the current UK curriculum (2014) expectations. The aim is to produce an excel document with names of children and scores in each level of difficulty. The test will only allow the children to proceed as long as they attain a certain score.

New Excel documents to be created on a daily basis when used. Creating a database of children's scores owver time.

Where errors occur, these should also be recorded in the spreadsheet which can be used to mail merge letters to parents advising them of focus areas and performance relative to age related expectation.
